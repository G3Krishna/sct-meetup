    "The use of list and Lists and Dictionaries to process data was to give you a very fundamental understanding on how data can be processed and loaded. However, when it comes to huge data, we will need a better and faster framework. Looping poses a serious overhead to performance. We will be discussing more on Numpy and Pandas and discuss how we can load and process data easily and efficiently.\n",
